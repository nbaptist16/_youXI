What is the setting of your game?
	The story takes place on the noble grounds of the prestigious Hyrule Academy, a knight training school.

What are some of the puzzles that you created/experimented with?
	Honestly, the biggest puzzle is the game itself, as you are sent on a scavenger hunt (after your friends have hidden your equipment) from the moment you start the game. The only actual puzzles in this game, though, are understanding the riddles, for I don’t particularly enjoy making fancy locks and stuff.

What are the two rooms? What are the three objects?
	Actually, there are six rooms in this game. You start in your room, and then you’ve got your friend, Pipit’s room, the dining hall, the bathroom, the hallway, and the outdoors to explore.

	As for objects? The only two required to complete the game are your sword and shield. However, to meet the requirements, there are other objects, like the maps and posters hanging in the hallway. (Apparently there are 26 total…)

Please discuss, in detail, one thing you learned how to do, and how you figured it out.
	One thing that I learned how to do…there were, actually, quite a few. However, despite it not being the most challenging problem (scoring and combat scene were a bit of a pain.. .), I learned how to make objects invisible: either introduce them as scenery, or don’t mention where they are located. (Although the latter is probably only possible if the object is obtainable in some other way. I didn’t test this, though.. .just guessing) As for how I figured it out.. .actually, I think the whole, “don’t give it a location” thing was kind of just an accident. I, for some reason, deleted the “in the [room]”, or 	even just forgot to write it, which left me with an invisible item :D

What resources were most helpful to you in your learning Inform?
	To be honest, there weren’t very many helpful resources. Most of the examples/example codes 	were outdated (or something like that), and did not work. Because of this, I could only use them as inspiration to my own solutions. Despite the majority of faulty code, there were a few lines that helped, like the enterable supporter code from Get That Cat 2.
